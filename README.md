I've redone some basic functions and made a more polished UI, running in nodejs, also added a point counter, the canvas is sized based on the window size at page load (start and end screen added)
```js
{
    author: {
      name: "Lo√Øc Rico",
      url: "https://github.com/ricoloic"
    },
    url: "https://invincible-ivy-coffee.glitch.me/",
    source: "https://github.com/ricoloic/snake-game"
}
```
